### What is this directory?
Here we will have some useful files to serve the developers who collaborate to MathAsm project.


## The purpose of this directory.
This directory is **NOT** part of MathAsm application. MathAsm should always build and run, even if one would delete this directory.

Here we (the developers of MathAsm) will share useful resources and notes that are useful to us.


### File structure
- Every resource is inside a directory.
- Every directory has a README.md file that speaks about the resource.
- A directory can contain multiple resources. But use the same dir for multiple ones only if they are really related.
- 


### Rules
- **Thou shall not commit any resource without a README.md file that explais to the rest of us what is this about.**
- **Thou shall not keep resources on the shame directory, unless they are really related to each other.
     Thou shall create separate directories with separate README.md files instead.**
- **Subdirectory structures are strongly encouraged. Those need no README.md file.**
- **When you commit new files here or update existing ones, tell the rest of the team about it. These are important news for the team.**
